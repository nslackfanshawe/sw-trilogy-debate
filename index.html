        <h2>Original Trilogy Argument</h2>
        <article>
        <p>The Original Trilogy is where Star Wars began with a trilogy of amazing movies, without them the rest of Star Wars wouldnâ€™t exist. They are what first introduced us to the universe of Star Wars, a legendary battle between the forces of good and evil, the Jedi vs the Sith, the Rebellion vs the Empire. Luke Skywalker and the rest of the cast are amazing characters that tell a compelling story with Luke starting as a poor farmer on Tatooine, rising to become a Jedi, and defeating a galaxy-spanning evil empire. They are full of high stakes, plot twists, and a great story that started the Skywalker Saga.</p>

        <p>While I am a big fan of the prequels as well, Revenge of the Sith is my favourite Star Wars movie, I believe that the Original Trilogy is a better trilogy. While they still have their moments the dialogue is not as serious as the Originals and the pacing isn't as good. For example is Anakin destroying the Trade Federation frigate in Episode 1, a 10-year-old boy who has never flown a starship flying into a heavily guarded capital ship during a battle and somehow destroying it. I understand he is meant to be a talented pilot and the chosen one, but that can only go so far. Another issue is there are major time skips between all three movies, while they are present in the Original Trilogy they are less obvious. An example is at the end of Attack of the Clones we see the beginning of the Clone Wars and at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith we see the end of them. While that did lead to an amazing animated show I would have liked to see the middle of the Clone Wars at least in flashbacks.</p>

        <p>That is why I believe that the Original Trilogy is a better trilogy than the prequels. To conclude both are fantastic but the Originals have more depth and better pacing.</p>
